    ----------
    So I haven't used project Eular before but I have practised some algorithmic stuff in C++ before a tech interview on HackerRank, so maybe we go through the track on functional programming and use Haskell as the language https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp/intro . So it starts of really simple, just to get you used to their interface, and some really basics but then you can jump ahead, its all free as well and you can just do the practice stuff no need to compete etc.
